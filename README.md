# SaalGallery
This project is a photo gallery manager.


This project is designed as a REST microservice.

The idea of the project is to create a gallery-type website where users can register and have a space to upload their photos and videos. Internally, the service uploads the images to https://supabase.com/, which provides a C# library with the ability to upload files and authenticate users. On the other hand, when processing the images, the main characteristics are extracted: date, camera model, and the camera that took the photo.

Due to time constraints and other obligations, I was not able to complete the frontend of the project, integrate it with the microservice, and deploy it.
